# WS-01 editor automation filter results

- **Current orchestration tip:** `c234606` (`[WS-10] Validate animation rejection responses structurally`)
- **Latest re-run tip:** `c234606`
- **Date:** 2026-07-30
- **Status:** Mixed after triage fixes. No A6 / POC-B completion claims.
- **Junction:** Not changed.

## Invocation

Each suite used the established runner:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File "tests/run_editor_tests.ps1" -KeepUeremcp -NoProbe -Filter "<filter>"
```

The runner launched `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe` with `-unattended -nop4 -nosplash -NullRHI -nosound` and `Automation RunTests <filter>; Quit`.

## Re-run on tip `c234606` (WS-11)

### PASS

| Filter | Result | Owner |
|---|---:|---|
| `UeremcpBlueprint.Toolset` | PASS, 4/4 | WS-06 |
| `UEREMCP.Niagara.Create` | PASS, 10/10 | WS-07 |

### INCOMPLETE (stalled; no completion marker)

| Filter | Progress | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UEREMCP.Niagara.Inspect` | 1/4 then stalled | WS-07 | Stalled after `NS_WS07_Probe` compile. Not a PASS. |
| `UEREMCP.Niagara.POCB.SixEmitterGateScaffold` (B7) | stalled | WS-07 | Stalled after creating/compiling `NS_POCB_FireballProbe`. Not a B7 or POC-B completion claim. |

### FAIL

| Filter | Result | Owner | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `UeremcpMaterial.Toolset` | 5/10 | WS-08 | VFX tests returned `failed_validation` (missing generated master/MI) where expected status was `partially_completed`. |
| `UEREMCP.Animation` | 8/10 | WS-10 | `InspectMontage.NotifyOrdering`: invalid track name did not degrade to empty. `InspectMontage.StructuredState`: transient asset had no Movie Scene; notify duration assert failed. |

### Not claimed by this re-run

- No A6 claim from Blueprint MutatingDispatch adapter gate.
- No POC-B / B7 completion claim from the stalled Niagara B7 gate.
- Templates automation filter registration remains out of scope for this note unless separately reported.

## Prior baseline on tip `fcdf2e5` (superseded for triage)

Recorded for history. Do not treat as current truth after `c234606`.

| Filter | Result |
|---|---:|
| `UEREMCP.Niagara.Inspect` | FAIL, 3/4 (`NS_WS07_Probe` rejected) |
| `UEREMCP.Niagara.Create` | FAIL, 8/10 |
| `UeremcpMaterial.Toolset` | FAIL, 3/10 |
| `UeremcpBlueprint.Toolset` | FAIL, 2/4 |
| `UEREMCP.Animation` | FAIL, 5/10 |
| `UEREMCP.Niagara.PlanHandlers` | PASS, 3/3 |
| `UEREMCP.Material.PlanHandlers` | PASS, 3/3 |
| `UEREMCP.Transport.Handoff` | PASS, 1/1 |
| `UEREMCP.Protocol.PlanExecutor` | PASS, 7/7 |
| Templates | SKIP / unavailable |

Evidence logs from that baseline remain under `tests/integration/_logs/editor_*_20260730_021*.log`.

## Ownership handoff

| Owner | Next work |
|---|---|
| WS-07 | Diagnose Niagara Inspect / B7 stalls after probe compile; re-run after fix. |
| WS-08 | Align NullRHI / missing-master VFX status ladder to honest `partially_completed` (or generate assets) for Material Toolset failures. |
| WS-10 | Fix NotifyOrdering empty-track degrade and StructuredState Movie Scene / notify duration asserts. |
| WS-11 | Re-run affected filters after domain fixes; keep A6 / POC-B claims gated to their own criteria. |

Standing by on orch for domain fix commits. No junction retarget.
